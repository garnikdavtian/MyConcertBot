# 🎵 Concert Tour Info Retrieval Service

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This Python service is designed to intelligently manage and retrieve detailed information about upcoming concert tours for 2025–2026.  
It allows users to:

- Upload new documents related to concert tours (plans, schedules, venues, performers, logistics)  
- Query the system to get precise answers strictly based on the ingested documents  

The core idea is to provide accurate, context-aware responses without relying on general external knowledge.

## 🔑 Core Functionalities

### 1. Document Ingestion  
- Analyzes incoming documents to check if they belong to the concert tour domain  
- If irrelevant, informs the user that the document cannot be ingested  
- If relevant, generates a concise summary of the document content  
- Indexes the summary for fast retrieval later  
- Returns the summary as confirmation to the user

### 2. Question Answering  
- Receives user queries about concert tours  
- Searches the indexed documents for relevant information  
- Generates precise answers based strictly on the retrieved data

### 3. Optional Bonus Feature: Online Search  
- If no documents are provided and the user inputs an artist/band name  
- Performs online search through public APIs  
- Retrieves info about upcoming concerts from public sources  
- Generates an answer based on this external data  
- This feature is separated from the core document-based system

### 4. User Interface (UI)  
- Provides a simple and user-friendly interface for interaction  
- Users can upload documents or type questions  
- Responses are displayed clearly in the interface

## 🛠 Tools and Technologies

The project can be implemented with Python and may use tools and libraries such as:

- Large Language Models (e.g., Ollama) for summarization and answer generation  
- Vector databases or search libraries for efficient document indexing and retrieval  
- Web frameworks (e.g., Streamlit) for building the user interface  
- Environment variables for secure API key management  
- API wrappers for online search services (optional bonus)

## ⚙ How to Run the Project

1. Prepare your Python environment (create and activate a virtual environment).  
2. Install all required dependencies.  
3. Configure environment variables with your API keys for the language model and online search (if used).  
4. Launch the user interface application.  
5. Upload documents or ask questions via the UI.

## Prerequisites to Run the Project
To successfully run this concert tours information retrieval service, please make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

Python 3.8 or higher — the project is written in Python, so a modern version is required.

Virtual environment tool (like venv) — recommended to isolate project dependencies.

Git — to clone and manage the repository.

Required Python packages:
Although requirements.txt is not included, the project depends on these main libraries:

langchain — for vector search and RAG system.

faiss-cpu — for efficient vector similarity search.

serpapi — for optional online artist search via SerpAPI.

streamlit (optional) — if you want to use the user interface.

Other typical libraries like numpy, requests, etc., may also be used.

API Keys:

SerpAPI key if you want to enable online search functionality. This key should be set as an environment variable (e.g., SERPAPI_KEY) and never hardcoded in the code.
