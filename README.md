# 🎵 Concert Tour Info Retrieval Service

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This Python service is designed to intelligently manage and retrieve detailed information about upcoming concert tours for 2025–2026.  
It allows users to:

- Upload new documents related to concert tours (plans, schedules, venues, performers, logistics)  
- Query the system to get precise answers strictly based on the ingested documents  

The core idea is to provide accurate, context-aware responses without relying on general external knowledge.

## 🔑 Core Functionalities

### 1. Document Ingestion  
- Analyzes incoming documents to check if they belong to the concert tour domain  
- If irrelevant, informs the user that the document cannot be ingested  
- If relevant, generates a concise summary of the document content  
- Indexes the summary for fast retrieval later  
- Returns the summary as confirmation to the user

### 2. Question Answering  
- Receives user queries about concert tours  
- Searches the indexed documents for relevant information  
- Generates precise answers based strictly on the retrieved data

### 3. Optional Bonus Feature: Online Search  
- If no documents are provided and the user inputs an artist/band name  
- Performs online search through public APIs  
- Retrieves info about upcoming concerts from public sources  
- Generates an answer based on this external data  
- This feature is separated from the core document-based system

### 4. User Interface (UI)  
- Provides a simple and user-friendly interface for interaction  
- Users can upload documents or type questions  
- Responses are displayed clearly in the interface

## 🛠 Tools and Technologies (Examples)

The project can be implemented with Python and may use tools and libraries such as:

- Large Language Models (e.g., OpenAI GPT) for summarization and answer generation  
- Vector databases or search libraries for efficient document indexing and retrieval  
- Web frameworks (e.g., Streamlit) for building the user interface  
- Environment variables for secure API key management  
- API wrappers for online search services (optional bonus)

## ⚙ How to Run the Project

1. Prepare your Python environment (create and activate a virtual environment).  
2. Install all required dependencies manually or using your preferred package manager.  
3. Configure environment variables with your API keys for the language model and online search (if used).  
4. Launch the user interface application.  
5. Upload documents or ask questions via the UI.
